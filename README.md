This is the code repository we prepared for our paper: 
**DatasetSAGE: A Structure-aware Multi-Agent Framework for Scientific Dataset Discovery with Grounded Evidence**.

This is the initial version of the current agent code. If the paper is accepted, we will release the complete code.

In the future, we also consider packaging this into **skills** and releasing it to the agent community.
